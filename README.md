# A-Closer-Look-at-the-Native-Tongue
A tutorial on how to analyze your everyday speech to generate a personalized list of words that optimizes which words to learn in a foreign language.

## The Premise 
Ever since I took three years of Spanish in high school, I've been dabbling with self-learning foreign languages.

What I wanted to know was: what is the most efficient way to learn a language? Is it possible to "fast-track" certain areas of language learning?

The takeaway from these videos is that language learning needs to be fun and it doesn't have to be extensive i.e. applying the 80/20 rule.
